# Workday Scheduler 
This Workday Scheduler Project focused on adding and developing code to provided HTML, CSS and Java-Script sources. Goals of this project were to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

# Usage
 This practice will provide future potential employers the opportunity to see student works in early learning of Java-Script, and API's such as Bootstrap and jQuery. 

# Features
This deployed and functional scheduler will respnd to the user typing in todo items into the text boxes and saving agenda items. When the page is refreshed, the saved changes will persist and be visable to the viewer. When the hour is past, the schedule will change tasked-hour to red (#ff6961) if present, green (#77dd77) if future, and grey #d3d3d3) if past.

# User Story (Provided)
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

The student also worked with a tutor and classmates via Slack and Zoom. The student also used universial resources such as  W3schools.com, FreeCodeCamp.org, the Class 'Resources' tab via Slack and jQuery/Bootstrap/FontAwsome/Moment libraries. Many thanks to those who continue to support learning in the technological community.
